# Summary app

This example app displays many different summaries of a table field. For example: max, min, average,
etc. It does this by using Airtable's built-in summary functions.

## How to run this app

1. Create a new base using the
   [Sales CRM template](https://airtable.com/templates/sales-and-customers/expvjTzYAZareV1pt/sales-crm).

2. Create a new app in your new base (see
   [Create a new app](https://airtable.com/developers/blocks/guides/hello-world-tutorial#create-a-new-app)),
   selecting "Summary" as your template.

3. From the root of your new app, run `block run`.
